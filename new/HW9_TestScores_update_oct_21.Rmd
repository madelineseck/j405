## Did a New Reading Program Lead to Better Scores?

The superintendent recently claimed that a new reading program has improved third-grade reading scores across the school district.

Before the program, third-grade students in the district averaged 72.6 points on standardized reading tests with a standard deviation of 4.8 points.

After implementing the program for one semester, you collected scores from 12 randomly selected classrooms:
74, 76, 73, 75, 78, 77, 74, 79, 75, 76, 77, 75

As a journalist, you need to determine: **Is there statistical evidence that reading scores have actually improved?**

## Task 1: Organize your data and initial assessment

Before you can run this codeblock, you will need to fill in a value where it says REPLACE_ME. That value can be found in the introduction.

```{r}
# Known information about reading scores before the new program
prior_mean <-72.6  # average score
prior_sd <- 4.8     # standard deviation

# Reading scores after implementing the new program (12 classrooms)
new_scores <- c(74, 76, 73, 75, 78, 77, 74, 79, 75, 76, 77, 75) # Replace with the actual scores

# Create a journalist-friendly dataset
score_data <- tibble(
  classroom = paste("Classroom", 1:12),
  reading_score = new_scores
)

# View the data
score_data
```

### Reflection Question 1:  (2 points)
Based on just looking at the score_data dataframe, have test scores improved? How can you tell?
#The test scores appear to have improved. The new average is about 76, compared to 72.6 before the new program.

## Task 2: Calculate key statistics  (2 points)

Like Task 1, you will need to replace values where it says REPLACE_ME before running any code.


```{r}
# Calculate statistics based on the new reading scores
new_stats <- score_data |> 
  summarise(
    mean = mean(reading_score),
    sd = sd(reading_score),
    n = n()
  )

new_stats
```

### Reflection Question 2: (3 points)
Looking at the mean and standard deviation of the new scores compared to the previous statistics, what initial observations can you make? Provide examples from the data in your answer. What questions might these statistics raise for your reporting?

#The new average reading score is 75.75, which is higher than the previous average of 72.6. Students performed better with the new reading program. The standard deviation of 1.76 is much smaller than 4.8. A question that I have is, were these 12 classrooms randomly selected and do they represent the entire district?
 

## Task 3: Create a column chart  (1 points)

As before, replace any values marked REPLACE_ME based the instructions.


```{r}
# STUDENT TASK: Choose an appropriate fill color for the bars
my_fill_color <- "blue" # Replace with a color name like "royalblue", "darkgreen", etc.

# Create a visualization comparing new scores to the previous average
score_data |> 
ggplot(aes(x = classroom, y = reading_score)) +
  geom_col(fill = my_fill_color, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = prior_mean, color = "darkred", size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  annotate("text", x = 2, y = prior_mean - 1, 
           label = "Previous Average (72.6)",  hjust = -0.5, vjust= 2, fontface = "bold", color = "darkred") +
  labs(
    title = "Reading Scores After New Program Implementation",
    subtitle = "Horizontal line shows previous district average of 72.6 points",
    x = NULL,
    y = "Reading Test Score",
    caption = "Source: District Assessment Data"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
  )
```

### Reflection Question 3: (3 points)
Examine the chart you created, and suggest a better title based on the results of the data, not a description.

#New Reading Program Boosts test Scores

## Task 4: Perform a hypothesis test (2 points)

This is where we formally test the superintendent's claim that reading scores have improved. Fill in the REPLACE_ME values as needed, beginning with your hypotheses.

**Hypotheses:**
Null: The new reading program REPLACE_ME
Alternative: The new reading program REPLACE_ME

```{r}
# Set the significance level for your test
alpha_level <- 0.05 # Replace with the appropriate value

# Perform a one-sample t-test
# Since we want to know if scores improved (increased), we use a one-sided test (alternative = "greater")
t_test_result <- t.test(
  score_data$reading_score,
  mu = prior_mean,
  alternative = "greater"
)

# Display the results
t_test_result
```

### Reflection Question 4:  (3 points)
What does the p-value tell you, and what doesn't it tell you? How would you explain these results to a non-technical audience while maintaining accuracy?

#the p-value says the sample mean greater than is greater than 72.6. On average, students scored about 3 points higher than before the new program. While this doesn’t prove the program caused the improvement, it show that scores have improved since it was launched.

## Task 5: Interpreting the results for your news story (2 points)

Let's gather all of the important stats we'll need in one place, so we can look at the prior average, the new scores and the results of the t.test, including the confidence interval. Replace any values where it says REPLACE_ME.


```{r}
# Get the p-value
p_value <- t_test_result$p.value

# Calculate the 95% confidence interval
ci <- t.test(score_data$reading_score)$conf.int

# Create a tibble to display the key statistics for your story
story_stats <- tibble(
  `Previous average` = prior_mean,
  `New average` = mean(new_scores),
  `Improvement` = mean(new_scores) - prior_mean,
  `Percent change` = round(((mean(new_scores) - prior_mean) / prior_mean) * 100, 1),
  `p-value` = p_value,
  `Lower bound` = ci[1],
  `Upper bound` = ci[2],
  `Confidence level` = "95%"
)

# Display the key statistics
story_stats
```

## Conclusion

### Reflection Question 5: (4 points)
Based on these statistics, what would be your headline and lead paragraph for this story? Is there evidence to support the superintendent's claim?

#Reading Scores Go Up After New Program

#New data from the school district shows that reading scores have increased by an average of 3.15 points, or about 4.3%, since the launch of a new reading program. The change is  unlikely to be due to chance. While this doesn’t prove the new reading program is the only reason for the improvement, the results strongly suggest it is having a positive impact on students’ reading skills.

### Reflection Question 6:  (1 point)
What metrics or outcomes beyond test scores might be important to track for assessing reading performance?
#Writing and grammer skills, reading comprehension, classroom participation and attendance
